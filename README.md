## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install reserved-email-addresses-list
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add reserved-email-addresses-list
```


## Usage

The string you are comparing with must be converted to lowercase, trimmed of whitespace, and strictly converted to alphanumeric characters only.

It is also highly recommended that you check for strict equality, and for a list of admin-related usernames, you should check for strict equality, starts with, or ends with comparisons as well.

```js
const reservedEmailAddressesList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list');
const reservedAdminList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list/admin-list.json');

const str = 'Admin***!!!'.toLowerCase().replace(/[^0-9a-z]/g, '');

let reservedMatch = reservedEmailAddressesList.find(addr => addr === str);

if (!reservedMatch)
  reservedMatch = reservedAdminList.find(
    addr => addr === str || str.startsWith(addr) || str.endsWith(addr)
  );

if (reservedMatch)
  throw new Error(
    `User must be a domain admin to create an alias with a reserved word (see the page on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="${config.urls.web}/reserved-email-addresses">Reserved Email Addresses</a>).`
  );

if (reservedMatch)
  throw new Error(`${str} matched a reserved email address of ${match}`);
```


## List

See [index.json](<>) for the complete list of all reserved email addresses.
