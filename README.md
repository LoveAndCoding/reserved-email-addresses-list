## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install reserved-email-addresses-list validator nodemailer
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add reserved-email-addresses-list validator nodemailer
```


## Usage

The string you are comparing with must be converted to lowercase and trimmed of whitespace. The reason we are converting to lowercase is because the dictionary of words we are comparing with are all lowercase, and in order to compare for strict equality, we must have matching case.

It is also highly recommended that you check for strict equality, and for a list of admin-related usernames, you should check for strict equality, starts with, or ends with comparisons as well.

```js
const reservedEmailAddressesList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list');
const reservedAdminList = require('reserved-email-addresses-list/admin-list.json');
const validator = require('validator');

const email = '"Admin***!!!"@example.com';

//
// NOTE: No current npm package validates an address properly to RFC/IDN spec
// however according to research in the link below, the `validator` library
// has the highest percentage of passing tests across edge cases
//
// <https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/104811/is-there-any-list-of-email-addresses-reserved-because-of-security-concerns-for-a/127447#comment173697_127447>
//
if (!validator.isEmail(email))
  throw new Error('Email was not a valid address');

//
// NOTE: No current npm package properly parses the local part of an email
// address, therefore we write some custom logic here to get the last @ symbol
// and then slice the string from 0 (first character) to the @ symbol)
//
// The problem is that packages parse based off the first `indexOf`
// and not the `lastIndexOf`, so therefore errors like this would occur:
// e.g. this is a valid email address: `"test@test.test"@example.com`,
// but it is parsed incorrectly by all packages
//
// <https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/issues/1102>
//
const lastIndexOfAtSymbol = email.lastIndexOf('@');
const str = email.slice(0, lastIndexOfAtSymbol).toLowerCase();

let reservedMatch = reservedEmailAddressesList.find(addr => addr === str);

if (!reservedMatch)
  reservedMatch = reservedAdminList.find(
    addr => addr === str || str.startsWith(addr) || str.endsWith(addr)
  );

if (reservedMatch)
  throw new Error(
    'User must be a domain admin to create an alias with a reserved word (see https://forwardemail.net/reserved-email-addresses).'
  );
```


## List

See [index.json](index.json) for the complete list of all reserved email addresses, and [admin-list.json](admin-list.json) for the list of all reserved admin names.
